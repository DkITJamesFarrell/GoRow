## Overview

GoRo is an Android mobile game that uses Bluetooth to integrate with Concept2 performance monitors to provide a fun, interactive, and competitive rowing experience. It works by extracting real-time rowing data about the users current workout to drive an in-game boat around a set of pre-defined courses. Users can view live stats about their current workout such as speed, stroke rate, stroke power, distance covered, and split time. Live graphs display the user's stats over time, and we provide users with options for switching various stats on and off. Users can participate in singleplayer time-trials where they race to beat their previous best times around a given track. Additionally, users can participate in head-to-head multiplayer races against other players online. Overall, GoRo brings physical interactions together with virtual gameplay to create an indoor rowing experience like never before.
